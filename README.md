Mathlive in a starboard notebook!

## TODO: Starboard stuff

Disconnect between Shift/Ctrl/Alt + Enter
(Alt+Enter seems weird) (to fix that bug, we'd need to introduce that "focused cell" concept)

Some quick shortcut/typing to insert a new cell type??

Undo and redo support for deleting/adding cells

Better UI

Replace node-sass with something newer (basically, upgrade the entire build pipeline)

Notebook in URL :thinking:

`Shift`+`Enter` at the last line: focuses the create cell button  
`js`: the search thingy is searching for js and suggests the Javascript cell type  
`Enter`: Inserts the Javascript cell

todo: alternative smart superscript: typing a plus or minus should jump out of the superscript  
todo: mathlive should automatically place/make big brackets  
todo: mathlive highlighting behaviour?
